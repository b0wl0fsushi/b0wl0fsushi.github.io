                            Natural groundwater recharge happens through the water cycle. Mainly through precolation. The water flows 
                            into aquifers using gravity as the force to pull it through the pores and into the aquifers below us.
                            This allows groundwater to recharge without human interactions. The benifits of using water gained from 
                            natural recharge is that it'll be flitered though many processes. If we start from the sea, evaporation
                            will pick up the water but leave the salt behind. After that once precipitation occurs the water will 
                            either experience runoff or head straight to precolation. While gravity pulls the water to an aquifer it
                            gets filtered through layers of rock and gravel. After that all thats left to do is to filter any bacteria
                            left using carbon or heat. Some downsides is that the large sum of water is avaliable in short periods of time.
                            Also, not all of the water from the precipitation ends up in an aquifer which could be biggest downside of
                            natural groundwater recharge.

                        Artificial groundwater recharge happens when water is moved using man-made systems to move water
                        into certain aquifers to create a level of balance in where land subsidence doesn't drastically
                        change the geography. Also it artificial recharge can also be water redirected through rivers into
                        different places. Many benefits come out of artificial recharge. Some of them include us knowing 
                        where we want the water and controllability. Also if there have been recent results of waste affecting
                        the soil then we can move the water to a noncontaminated area. Although the water might not get the full
                        natural filtration process water plants can easily overcome this problem. Some downfalls are that
                        even though there is controllability over the water it doesn’t mean the water meets California's
                        standards for drinking water. The material of aqueducts could affect the water’s drinking 
                        capability.
