        <div style = "column-count: 3; column-rule: solid 2px black">
                The environment would gain many benefits including the fact that we don’t have to use up precious minerals and 
                elements to create the industrial machinery made for desalination plants which in the making in such machines 
                would release lots of CO2 emissions. Along with the fact of using precious minerals while using groundwater as 
                a method to gain water it would cost less meaning we don't have to make that much money which is 75% cotton and 
                25% linen. Others might oppose with the fact that it take you use up minerals to reach the aquifer. Yes that is
                true but in the long run if we didn’t take the jump to use those minerals we would be wasting more in the long run.
                Another one is about the quality or the freshness of the water people might say that water is dirty and the unsaturated
                zone is the only one we could access it is exposed to germs and non sterile air. Although we can settle for the unsaturated
                zone we can actually reach the saturated zone with water that has been pulled down through filters by gravity over the
                centuries. My best bet is that it has been filter pretty thoroughly. What if that when they open an opening to pump the water
                germs start rushing in. That would nearly impossible due to the fact that there is no contact between the air and the water 
                that result in the transfer of bacteria. Someone might talk about how pumping too much water could lead to land subsidence 
                and how it can destroy the landscape. Yes that could happen if your not being careful about how you pump the water. By 
                pump water evenly and disturbing pumps increases the likelihood of the water table slowly move downwards to form a non 
                dilapidated shape. As when you are not careful and you suck up all the water in that one area while other parts of the 
                aquifer are fill causing the land to morph in shape. These were the three main reasons of controversy that have all been
                explained
