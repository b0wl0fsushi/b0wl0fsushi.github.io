            Most of society treats water like it as an everyday substance what many people don't understand is that water is not an infinite substance. 
            When you press the <button class = "btn btn-outline-dark" data-target = "#img" data-toggle = "collapse" style = "background-color: whitesmoke">Extend</button>
            button a picture should pop up showing how many states daily lives are affected by groundwater. When looking at 
            it shows that for the majority of our countries use or are affected by groundwater. Which show that many people in society use it and it 
            is a very helpful substance. Most often people will use a desalination process or a reservoir to gain freshwater quickly. What they don’t 
            understand is that using groundwater recharge will do the exact same thing but even better. It requires no making of industrial machinery 
            while others do. Also, it requires less human labor than all of the other options. This allows to cover all the demands of society with more 
            to spare. Then again you can oppose with saying that take longer to do so and it’ll be dirty with all of dirt it passes through. It might 
            take a long time but aquifers already come with a whole load of water to last enough time for it to be filtered. On the topic of filtered while 
            gravity pulls down the water it actually gets filtered through all the rocks and soil it pass through.
