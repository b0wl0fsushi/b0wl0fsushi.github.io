    <h2>This is my Homework</h2>
    <p>After getting all settled in with what was going on Johnny proclaimed, “All of these DVD’s look great, I can’t decide on which one to pick.” “I know right, all of these DVDs are great.” agreed Katey. Once decide they went up to the cashier and said, “Excuse me, we would like 42 and 43.” In correlation he said, “Sorry, we are out of stock in both of those DVDs” “What! No way” she exclaimed after hearing such horrible news. “Yeah, we’re experiencing  problems in shipment because someone mixed up the schedules and it’s coming in about a month. So long story short you're going to be waiting a month.” the cashier sadly told them. After finding this out they decide to wait a month. “Aw man all this trouble is giving me a headache.” said Katey. “Don’t worry,  your fine it’s just a month.” Johnny reassured her.</p>
